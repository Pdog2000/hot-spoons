Two player, single-button game played on an LED strand.

Each player uses their button to launch colored projectiles from opposite ends
of the strand toward a white "puck" in the center, moving it toward the
opposing side. Each shot will lock out all other shots for a brief moment,
allowing you to block enemy shots if you can predict when they will be fired
and shoot just before.
