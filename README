Games and lighting effects for a WS2811 LED strand.
Based largely on code from http://funkboxing.com/wordpress/?p=1366

This program includes 3 game variants and an array of lighting effects.
Game modes are two-player and require one button per player for interaction.
Lightshow mode uses the same two buttons to navigate between different effects.
A third button is used to cycle between the game variants and a lightshow mode.
Details on each mode are given below.

*FREEPLAY MODE*
Each player uses their button to launch colored projectiles from opposite ends
of the strand toward a "puck" in the center, moving it toward the
opposing side. The game resets when the puck reaches one end of the strand.
If using audio output, sounds are generated when you score.

*TIMING MODE*
Same as freeplay mode but players may only shoot when the puck turns white,
which happens randomly. Shooting when the puck is not white will be penalized
by moving the puck toward you a small distance.

*SPECTRUM MODE*
(requires additional hardware)
Same as freeplay mode but shots are also fired by audio-based triggers read
from the analog input pins.

*LIGHTSHOW MODE*
Displays a single lighting effect. Use buttons or serial commands to change
effects. Serial commands should look like "m 5", where 5 is the mode number. If
using Arduino's serial monitor, be sure to choose "Newline" in the line-ending
dropdown seletor box.

*DEMO MODE*
Loops through various effects, blocks out serial commands and button inputs for a while.
To exit demo mode you will probably need to hit the reset button.
