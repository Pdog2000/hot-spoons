Two player, single-button game played on an LED strand.

V1.0
Each player uses their button to launch colored projectiles from opposite ends
of the strand toward a white "puck" in the center, moving it toward the
opposing side. Each shot will lock out all other shots for a brief moment,
allowing you to block enemy shots if you can predict when they will be fired
and shoot just before. 

V2.0 
Each player uses their button to launch colored projectiles from their 
end to push the white puck toward their opponent. If they launch 
immediately before their opponent, they score a point or two or three.
If they launch and their opponent does NOT launch, their shot bounces 
off their opponent's shield and scores a point for their opponent!

V2.1
Add pew() and bew() which are routines to make noises when scores.
