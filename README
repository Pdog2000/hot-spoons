Hot Spoons!
-----------

Each player taps their spoons together to launch colored projectiles from
opposite ends of the strand toward a "puck" in the center, moving it toward the
opposing side. Each player has their own color. We use PINK and GREEN
projectiles and the spoons are color-coded to match. Players may only shoot
when the puck turns BLUE which happens randomly. Shooting when the puck is RED
will be penalized by moving the puck toward you a small distance. The game
resets when the puck reaches one end of the strand. If using audio output,
sounds are generated when you score.

Hardware requirements:
Arduino - I use an Arduino Mega 2560
LED strip - I use a WS2812 strip
5V LED power supply - amperage depends on strip length
4 Spoons - These are wired to work as button inputs to the Arduino
